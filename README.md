# Determine if the friendship paradox holds for my Facebook
account.* Compute the mean, standard deviation, and median of the
number of friends that my friends have.  Create a graph of the
number of friends (y-axis) and the friends themselves, sorted by
number of friends (x-axis).  (The friends don't need to be labeled
on the x-axis: just f1, f2, f3, ... fn.)  Do include me in the graph
and label me accordingly.

So we came up with answers.In the first question I downloaded the XML file from the website using python
that contains four defs(functions). First function contains the piece of code that
gets the line from the XML file having the word \friends count" but as a whole
string. Then I create another function to get the number that is specifed withthe
\ friend count" and put it in a text file. Finally I perform the mean,standard
deviation and median calculations to get the requirements.

The code with graphs in Report PDF and python file inQ2


# Then we have a second problem:

Determine if the friendship paradox holds for your Twitter account.
Since Twitter is a directed graph, use "followers" as value you measure
(i.e., "do your followers have more followers than you?").

Generate the same graph as in question #1, and calcuate the same 
mean, standard deviation, and median values.

Answer:In problem 2, using Twitter API we extract the followers from twitter account
after that I use the same program to develop the standard deviation and median
to get the calculations based on every and each follower I have in the list.
